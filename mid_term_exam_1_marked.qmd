## Conceptual Questions

**Total points: 15**

Please include all work (and computations) necessary to answer the questions.

### Question 1

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

The following is a list of observed values, ordered from lowest to highest: 62, 63, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 72, 74, 75, 76. What is an accurate five-number summary for these data?

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(wbstats)
library(poliscidata)
library(countrycode)
library(broom)
library(janitor)
library(ggridges)
library(modelsummary)
```

```{r}
x <- c(62, 63, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 72, 74, 75, 76)
summary(x)
```

### Question 2

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

Suppose that the median, Q1, and Q3 from question #1 is an accurate representation of a second (hypothetical) distribution. Based on what this information tells you about this second distribution, which of the following numbers would be a suspected outlier?

A.  76

B.  62

C.  **83**

D.  Both (A) and (C)

E.  All of the above

F.  None of the above, or cannot be determined from the information given.

### Question 3

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

There is a group of three children with the following ages: 3, 4, and 5. If a 6-year-old child joins the group, what will happen to the mean and standard deviation of the group's age?

```{r}
age_group <- c(3,4,5)
mean(age_group)
sd(age_group)

new_group <- c(age_group,6)
mean(new_group)
sd(new_group)
```

If a 6-year old child join the new group the mean will increase from 4 to 4.5 and the standard deviation will also increase from 1 to 1.2

### Question 4

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

If I estimate an OLS regression and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.40 where the Total Sum of Squares of 4,150, what does the Residual Sum of Squares equal?

R2 = 1 - RSS/TSS

R2 = 0.40

TSS = 4150

```{r}
r_two <- 0.40
tss <- 4150

rss <- tss * (1 - r_two)
rss
```

### Question 5

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

The distribution of some variable has a median that is smaller than its mean. Which of the following statements about the distribution's shape is most consistent with this information?

A.  The shape of the distribution would be symmetric
B.  The shape of the distribution would be skewed left
C.  **The shape of the distribution would be skewed right**
D.  None of the above -- cannot be determined from the information given.

It is skewed to the right because in right skewed, the tails are longer than the left and most of the data values are clustered on the left side.

### Question 6

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

Suppose I want to test the hypothesis that the U.S. public's approval of the president is higher when people have more positive perceptions of the U.S. economy. To test this hypothesis, I conduct a survey of individual-level attitudes. Which of the following research design strategies should I expect to exhibit both the greatest sampling variability (in the context of repeated sampling) and the lowest degree of expected sampling bias?

A.  A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses
B.  A random sample of 600 people from a list of all registered students at the University of Maryland
C.  A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all registered students at the University of Maryland
D.  **A random sample of 600 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses.**

### Question 7

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
0/1
:::

The median age of ten people in a room is 50 years. One 40-year-old person leaves the room. What can we expect will happen to the median age for the remaining nine people? Do we know the median age of those nine people; if so, what is it?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
ages <- c(35, 33, 39, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 58, 60)
sort(ages)
summary(ages)
ages1 <- c(35, 33, 39, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 58)
summary(ages1)
```

If the median ages of ten people is 50, that means the ages are not that far apart from each other. Hypothetically, if we say the ages are 35, 33, 39, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 58, and 60. And if we put the ages in ascending order, the median would be 50 in this case

But If the 40 year old person leaves the room and that person is from the first four or the last four group, the median would still be around 50. So, theoretically, we can confirm what will happen to the renaming nine people without having the real ages of the people

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
The 40 year old cannot be in the four oldest people in the group if the original median is 50 years old.

The median age of the group will either stay the same or increase. If no one or one person in the group is 50 years old, the median age of the group will increase. For example:

```{r}

age_dist <- c(40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60)

median(age_dist)
```

Removing the 40 year old increases the median to the next age above 50 years old in the group:

```{r}

new_age_dist <- c(42, 44, 46, 48, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60)

median(new_age_dist)
```

If; however, two or more people in the group are 50 years old, the median will remain at 50. For example:

```{r}

age_dist <- c(40, 42, 44, 46, 50, 50, 54, 56, 58, 60)

median(age_dist)
```

Removing the 40 year old increases the median to the next age above 50 years old in the group (which is 50 years old):

```{r}

new_age_dist <- c(42, 44, 46, 50, 50, 54, 56, 58, 60)

median(new_age_dist)
```
:::

### Question 8

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

The mean age of ten people in a room is 50 years. One 70-years-old person leaves the room. What can we expect will happen to the mean age for the remaining nine people? Do we know the mean age of those nine people; if so, what is it?

10 \* 50 = 500

500 - 70 = 430

430/9 = 47.7

the mean age decrease for the remaining 9 people to 47.7

### Question 9

*1 point*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/1
:::

Which of the following sets of numbers has the largest standard deviation?

A.  **2, 4, 6, 8**
B.  7, 8, 9, 10
C.  5, 5, 5, 5
D.  1, 2, 3, 5

```{r}
nu_1 <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
nu_2 <- c(7, 8, 9, 10)
nu_3 <- c(5, 5, 5, 5)
nu_4 <- c(1, 2, 3, 5)
sd(nu_1)
sd(nu_2)
sd(nu_3)
sd(nu_4)
```

A has the largest standard deviation of 2.5

### Question 10

I hypothesize that **people with greater social trust are more likely to turnout to vote in American national elections**. I use data from the 2012 General Social Survey to examine how respondents' self-reported level of social trust might be correlated with their decisions to vote. In particular, I use the `social_trust` variable (i.e., a 4-point ordinal indicator of social trust -- larger values reflect greater trust) and the `vote08` variable (i.e., a dichotomous indicator where a `1` indicates that the respondent voted) to test my hypothesis.

Complete the cross-tab below so that you may properly evaluate my hypothesis. Briefly interpret the results of your completed cross-tab. Do the data suggest that social trust is related to voting in 2008? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

Among the respondents those with highest (3) social trust have voted the most (89%), those with moderately high (2) social trust have voted 77% while only 22% did not vote. Compared to those with lower level of social trust (1) only 67% voted and 33% did not vote. And among those with no (0) social trust only 65% voted and 34% did not vote.

Based on this, the data supports the hypothesis. We can see that as level of social trust increases so does the percentage of people turning to vote. This suggests that people with high level of social trust are more likely to vote than does with lower level of social trust.

## Applied Questions

Please include your R code. All data sets referenced below are available through the `poliscidata` R-package.

**Total points: 20**

### Question 1

*10 points total*

5/10
:::

Use the `states` dataset (the U.S. state is the unit of analysis) and **estimate a bivariate regression** where the size of a state's urban population (`urban`) explains variation in abortion attitudes (`permit`) and **report the results in a professionally formatted table**. The variable `permit` measures the percentage (on a 0-to-100 scale) of a state's population that says abortion should always be allowed. The variable `urban` measures the percentage (on a 0-to-100 scale) of a state's population in an urban area. Answer the following questions.

```{r}
regr_lm <- lm(permit ~ urban, data = states)
regr_lm
modelsummary(
  regr_lm, 
  statistic = NULL,
  coef_rename = c("permit" = "urban"),
  gof_map = "nobs")

```

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
Please make sure to provide meaningful variable labels in your professionally formatted tables. `urban` is not meaningful to your readers.
:::

A.  Interpret the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. *2 points*

    \*\*\*use coefficient to answer (interpret) the effect of the iV on the DV

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
1/2
:::

```{r}
    states |> 
      ggplot(aes(x = urban, y = permit))+
      geom_point()+
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)+
      theme_minimal()
    cor(states$urban, states$permit, use = "complete.obs")
```

The effect of the Independent variable on the dependent variable is positive, but (somewhat) weak. As we can see from the plot there appear to be correlation of .5 And the urban population effect on the state population of those who agree abortion should be allowed is .37 so this estimate suggest that as increase of state urban population the state population that say abortion should be allowed increases as well.

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
Almost! If the percentage of a state's population that lives in an urban area increases by one percentage point, the percentage of the state's population that says abortion should always be allowed increases by 0.373 percentage points, on average.
:::

B.  Interpret the estimate of the intercept. Is it substantively meaningful to interpret this coefficient on its own? Explain why, or why not. *2 points*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
0/2
:::

In this model our intercept is 9.6 this represents the percentage of the states population that says abortion should be allowed. And our independent variable, urban, shows 0.3 of urban population.

Based on this i think i think it is not substantively meaningful to interpret this coefficient because are the population in the urban is nearly 0.

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
The intercept provides our predicted outcome when our independent variable is set to zero. If zero percent of a state's population lives in an urban area, the percentage of the state's population that says abortion should always be allowed is 9.64 percent, on average. Because there are no states that have no urban centers, the intercept coefficient is not substantively meaningful to interpret on its own.
:::

C.  Compute the residual sum of squares for the following two observations combined: (1) California; and (2) Texas. *2 points*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}

```{r}
    stat <- states |> 
      filter(stateid%in%c("CA    ", "TX    ")) |>
      column_to_rownames("stateid") |> 
      select(urban, permit)

    stat_pred <- augment(regr_lm, newdata = stat)
    stat_pred
```

```{r}
    stat_pred |> 
      summarise(sum(.resid^2))
```

D.  How well does the model fit the data (i.e., how well can we explain abortion attitudes with this model?) *2 points*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
2/2
:::

```{r}
    glance(regr_lm) |> 
      select(r.squared)
```

The model does not fit the data that well. According to our model, only 27% of the variance in abortion attitudes (permit) is explained by the urban population size.

E.  Is the relationship between the independent and dependent variable causal? Why or why not? *2 points*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
0/2
:::

```{r}
    glance(regr_lm) |> 
      select(r.squared)
```

    No. Although we have a positive correlation of .5, the variance between the independent and the dependent variable is very low at 27%. I think there might be confounding variables that is might effect the urban pop and the abortion attitudes that isnt in this model. So, it is not clear from the regression if there is causal relation between

##we can find causality in regression analysis. we can only determine correlation

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
OLS regression finds correlations among variables. Correlation does not imply causation. We cannot use regression analysis alone to determine a causal relationship.

### Question 2

*5 points*

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
5/5
:::

Use the `gss` data set (the unit of analysis is the individual survey respondent) and evaluate the hypothesis that **Republicans had less confidence in the executive branch of the federal government than Democrats in 2016.** Use the following variables: `partyid` is a 7-category ordinal indicator (0 = Strong Democrat; 1 = Weak Democrat; 2 = Independent Democrat; 3 = Independent; 4 = Independent Republican; 5 = Weak Republican; 6 = Strong Republican); and `confed` is a 3-category ordinal indicator (1 = "a great deal" of confidence; 2 = "only some;" 3 = "hardly any"). Do the data support the hypothesis and how do you know?

```{r}
library(poliscidata)
library(modelsummary)
datasummary_crosstab(partyid ~ confed, data = gss)
```

Among the respondents, strong democratcs ("StrDem") appear to have more (19.9%) confidence on the execute branch than strong republicans ("StrRep") at 3.1%. Furthermore, lack of confidence ("hardly any") is lowest among Strong Democrats and generally increases as we move towards Strong Republicans.

Based on the crosstab, the hypothesis appears to be supported. Among the republicans, especially strong Republicans, tend to have less confidence ("hardly any") in the executive branch of the federal government compared to their Democrat counterparts in 2016. The increasing percentages of respondents with less confidence ("hardly any") as we move from Democratic to Republican showcases this trend.

### Question 3

*5 points*

:::

Use the `world` dataset and evaluate the distributions for each the following variables: `literacy` (a country's literacy rate) and `free_overall` (a country's degree of economic freedom). Be sure to visually display each distribution and thoroughly describe their key attributes. Next, evaluate the bivariate relationship between the two variables -- i.e., is economic freedom associated with literacy? If so, what is the nature of the relationship and how do you know? In doing so, be sure to use proper descriptive tools (and thus do not rely simply on a regression output).

```{r}
library(poliscidata)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
ggplot(world,aes(x = literacy, y = free_overall))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Literacy rate", y = " Degree of economic freedom")+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
cor(world$literacy, world$free_overall, use = "complete.obs")
```

::: {.callout-tip title="HG comments"}
The question asks you to discuss the distribution of `literacy` and `free_overall` individually. What shape are they? How spread out are they? Where are their center points?
:::

The relationship between literacy rate and economic freedom appear to be positive. As literacy rates increase, the degree of economic freedom also tends to increase. We can see that a great number of data points are clustered towards the higher end of the literacy scale, especially between 80% to 100%. we can also see that a great number of countries have economic freedom rating around between 40 and 60 with little bit higher around 60. Also, i think there might be some (candidates) outliers, right around the 90 - 100 mark of literacy rate, which are not corresponding to high economic freedom. And although the relathionship is postive (with a correlation of .4), i think the strengthen of the relationship is somewhat moderate based on the how close the data points are to the line.

Based on the this scatterplot, countries with higher literacy rates tend to have a higher degree of economic freedom, and vice versa (with the exception of few). Although, there appear to be correlation between literacy rate and degree of economic freedom this does not mean causuality. I think further analysis is required to determine causality.

```{r}
library(poliscidata)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
ggplot(world, aes(x= free))

skimr::skim(world$free_overall|> 
              select(numeric.mean:mean:numeric.hist) |>
