```{r}
#| echo: false

tibble::tibble(
  `Age group` = c("18-24", "25-30", "31 and up", "TOTAL"),
  `Non-voters` = c(70, 40, 220, 330),
  Voters = c(50, 50, 570, 670),

### Part A

*Points: 2*

::: callout-tip
2/2
:::

What is the probability of being 25-30 or a non-voter?

P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A and B)

P(A)= 25-30 = 90/1000 = 0.09

P(B) = non voter = 330/1000 = 0.33

P(A and B)= 40/1000 = 0.04

P (A or B) = 0.09 + 0.033 - 0.04

P A or B) = 0.038

::: callout-tip
Small typo above. Answer is 0.38.

Assuming a normal distribution, report the 95% confidence intervals for the percentage of 18-to-24-year-olds who did not vote, and then the percentage of 25-to-30-year-olds who did not vote.

```{r}

ci <- function(p, n) {
  se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) 
  lower_range <- p - 1.96*se
  upper_range <- p + 1.96*se
  return(c(lower_range, upper_range))
}
p_18_24 <- 70/120
ci_18_24 <- ci(p_18_24, 120)

p_25_30 <- 40/90
ci_25_30 <- ci(p_25_30, 90)
```

```{r}
list(ci_18_24 = ci_18_24, ci_25_30 = ci_25_30)
```

::: callout-tip
The probability that an individual is 18-to-24 and a non-voter is not conditional. Therefore, you look at the proportion of the whole population who meet those criteria.

$$
\hat{p} = Pr(18\ to\ 24 \& NV) = \frac{70}{1000} = 0.07 
$$

And:

$$
n = 1000
$$

Therefore:

$$
SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{0.07 * 0.93}{1000}} = 0.008068457
$$

The 95% confidence interval can be found:

$$
\hat{p} \pm 1.96*SE(\hat{p})
$$

Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the percentage of 18-to-24-year-olds who did not vote is `r percent(0.07 - 1.96 * 0.008068457, accuracy = 0.01)` to `r percent(0.07 + 1.96 * 0.008068457, accuracy = 0.01)`.

Using the same method, the 95% confidence intervals for the percentage of 25-to-30-year-olds who did not vote is `r percent(0.04 - 1.96*0.006196773, accuracy = 0.01)` to `r percent(0.04 + 1.96*0.006196773, accuracy = 0.01)`.

Assume that the standard deviation for the population distribution of a state in which you want to conduct a poll is 200.

### Part A

:::

Calculate the spread of the sampling distribution for each of the following sample sizes: 1, 4, 25, 100, 250, 1000, 5,000, and 10,000.

```{r}
sd <- 200 
sample_dis <- c(1, 4, 25, 100, 250, 1000, 5000, 10000)
se <- sd / sqrt(sample_dis)

data.frame(Sample_distribution =sample_dis, Standard_error = se)
```

```{**n = 1**}

$SE = \frac{200}{\sqrt{1}}=200$

**n =4**

$SE = \frac{200}{\sqrt{4}}=100$

\`\`\`

### Part B

*Points: 1*

::: callout-tip
0.5/1
:::

Describe specifically how the variability of the sampling distribution changes as the sample size varies. Considering the expense of running a poll, which sample size do you think is most optimal if conducting the poll?

From this case, we can see that there is an inverse relationship. We can see that as the sample size goes up the standard error goes down. this means as we draw larger samples, the sample distribution of the n becomes less variable.

::: callout-tip
You only partially answered the question: which sample size do you think is most optimal if conducting the poll?

### Part C

:::

Display your results graphically (using R) with the sample size on the x-axis and the standard error (of the sampling distribution) on the y-axis.

library(ggplot2)

sample_sizes <- c(1, 4, 25, 100, 250, 1000, 5000, 10000)
pop_sd <- 200
s_error <- pop_sd / sqrt(sample_sizes)


df <- data.frame(sample_sizes, s_error)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=sample_sizes, y=s_error)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(breaks = sample_sizes, labels = sample_sizes) + 
  labs(title="Standard Error by Sample Size",
       x="Sample Size",
       y="Standard Error") +
  theme_classic()
print(p)
```

## Question 3

*Points: 4*

::: callout-tip
4/4
:::

Suppose you conduct a survey (to generate a sample mean of interest) and find that it has a margin of error of 4.5 with a sample size of 900 using a 95% confidence interval. What would the margin of error be for a 90% confidence interval?

```{r}
zs_95 <- 1.96
me_95 <- 4.5
zs_90 <- 1.645

se <- me_95/zs_95
zs_90*se
```

The MOE for 90% confident interval is 3.7

## Question 4

*Points: 4*

::: callout-tip

:::

Assume that, in State A, the mean income in the population is \$20,000 with a standard deviation of \$2,000. If you took an SRS of 900 individuals from that population, what is the probability that you would get a sample mean income of \$20,200 or greater? What would be the probability if the sample size was only 25?

::: callout-note
Assume a normal distribution for both questions.
:::

n = 900

$SE=\frac{2000}{\sqrt{900}}=\frac{2000}{{30}}= 66.6$\$

$\ Z = \frac{20200 - 20,000}{66.6}=3$

P (x̄\>= 20200) = 1 - 0.9987

P (x̄ \>= 20200) = 0.0013

```{r}
avg_income <- 20000
sd <- 2000

n_900 <- 900
se_900 <- sd / sqrt(n_900)
z_900 <- (20200 - avg_income) / se_900
p_900 <- 1 - pnorm(z_900)  

data.frame(probability_900 = p_900)

```

```{r}
n_25 <- 25
se_25 <- sd / sqrt(n_25)
z_25 <- (20200 - avg_income) / se_25
p_25 <- 1 - pnorm(z_25)
data.frame(probability_25 = p_25)
```

Assume that a coin is fair. If I flip a coin 500 times, what is a 95% confidence interval for the range of the count of heads that I will get? What if I flip the coin 5,000 times? What about 50,000 times?

```{r}
n_500 <- 500
p_500 <- 0.5

z_500 <- qnorm(0.975)


ci_95_500 <- c(p_500 -z_500 * sqrt(p_500 *(1 - p_500)/ n_500),
               p_500 + z_500 * sqrt(p_500 * (1 - p_500)/ n_500))
print(ci_95_500)
```

```{r}
n_5000 <- 5000
p_5000 <- 0.5

z_5000 <- qnorm(0.975)


ci_95_5000 <- c(p_5000 -z_5000 * sqrt(p_5000 *(1 - p_5000)/ n_5000),
               p_5000 + z_5000 * sqrt(p_5000 * (1 - p_5000)/ n_5000))


print(ci_95_5000)
```

```{r}
n_50000 <- 50000
p_50000 <- 0.5

z_50000 <- qnorm(0.975)


ci_95_50000 <- c(p_50000 -z_50000 * sqrt(p_50000 *(1 - p_50000)/ n_50000),
               p_50000 + z_50000 * sqrt(p_50000 * (1 - p_50000)/ n_50000))

print(ci_95_50000)

```

::: callout-tip
Almost! The question asks for the confidence interval for the range of the *count* of heads. So, your center point should the number of heads you flipped in these trials. If you have a 50% chance of getting heads when you flip a fair coin, your expected number of heads should be 250, 2,500, and 25,000 heads from each trial. You calculate your confidence around this result.

```{r}
p_head <- 0.5

tibble(
  flips = c(500, 5000, 50000),
  expected_n_heads = flips*p_head,
  sd = sqrt(flips*p_head*(1-p_head)),
  lower_ci = expected_n_heads - qnorm(0.975)*sd,
  upper_ci = expected_n_heads + qnorm(0.975)*sd
) |> 
  knitr::kable()
